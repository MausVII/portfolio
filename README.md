# My Personal Portfolio
## Where
You can find the current development build at www.valpuentenc31.com
## How
For the most part just frontend React. There is some logic used to make a carousel like component that I will refactor into a more general use version later.
## Why
I would like a job. It's sometimes hard learning in your own because you don't have anyone guiding you in what you should learn like in College, you just have to figure out what you're lacking by yourself. I, somewhat, miss that structured form of learning where you know where you're meant to be heading.
